Revision history for Perl extension XML::Dumper.

      A while back, there was a suggestion to use the file header rather
      than the file extension '.tar.gz' or '.tgz' to detect tarballed
      files, which is correct. Unfortunately, I lost the e-mail that
      had the patch, so if the author of said e-mail or other interested
      parties could re-submit the patch, I'll be glad to incorporate it.

0.63  Wed Jun 18 14:18:00 PDT 2003
    - Added 'use warnings' pragma and applied patch to bugs. Both the bug 
      report and the patch were supplied by Honza Holecek. Thanks, Honza!

0.62  Sun Jan 12 19:48:12 PST 2003
    - Added the ability to dump a DTD for a valid XML document. Investigating
	  more interesting forms of XML data (given DTD or Schema, slurp XML into
	  Perl and back). Corrected errors in POD, Changes, README, and tests.

0.60  Tue Jan  7 22:00:15 PST 2003
    - Responded to some old comments by crazyinsomniac, from Perl Monks. 
	  The module now dumps and undumps with or without the OO-ish interface. 
	  I might add the punDump feature, but the feedback from pun-loving Perl 
	  monks may lead to pun-demonium.

0.59  Thu Nov 28 22:43:51 PST 2002
	- Responded to bug report by Peter S. May. XML::Dumper now correctly
	  interprets undef() values as being undefined as opposed to being a zero-
	  length string. 
	- Added capability to distinguish the difference between a reference to
	  a zero-length string and a reference to an undefined value. While the
	  use model escapes me at the moment, it was the consistent and right
	  thing to do.
	- Moved credits and changes from perldoc to Changes file.

0.58  Thu Nov 28 13:22:18 PST 2002
	- Added optional feature to read and write zlib-compressed XML. Added
	  optional dependency to Compress::Zlib.

0.57
	- Responded to bug report by Niels Vegter. Code now better handles literal
	  scalar references. 
	- Changed the rest of the test suite to scale better, using some more of 
	  the features of Test::Harness

0.56
	- Added file reading and writing features

0.55
	- Removed documentation of non-implemented code, fixed MANIFEST errors.
	  Fixed false dependency on Data::Dumper

0.54
	- Added ability to handle soft referenced callbacks

0.53
	- Added ability to handle circular references

0.5
	- XML::Dumper changes ownership from Jon Eizenzopf to Mike Wong
	- Added ability to dump and undump Perl objects

0.4   Sun Jun 20 02:29:12 EDT 1999
