NAME
XML::Dumper Version 0.56

DESCRIPTION
XML::Dumper dumps Perl data to a structured XML format.
XML::Dumper can also read XML data that was previously dumped
by the module and convert it back to Perl.

This might be useful for dumping Perl objects to files
using an XML format that can be reloaded or accessed by
other programs. Maybe even other languages.

For more information, read the perldoc for this module.

I (Mike Wong) am the current maintainer; I welcome bug reports,
comments and suggestions to make this a better module for helping
you to do what you need. Contact me via e-mail at 
<mike_w3@pacbell.net>. 

Better yet, if you're in Sonoma County of California, USA, join the 
Sonoma Perl Mongers and we can talk there. For more information on
