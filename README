NAME
XML::Dumper Version 0.01

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Larry Wall wrote the original XML::Parser which uses
James Clark's expat XML parser. Clark Cooper is the present
maintainer of the XML::Parser module, and has been a
great help.

DESCRIPTION
This is a simple little package I whipped up for an article

data structures to XML and converting XML to perl data 
structures. 

Feel free to contact me at eisen@pobox.com if you have 
problems and/or suggestions.
