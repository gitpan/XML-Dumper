README for XML::Dumper 
======================

XML::Dumper dumps Perl data to a structured XML format.
XML::Dumper can also read XML data that was previously dumped
by the module and convert it back to Perl.

This might be useful for dumping Perl objects to files
using an XML format that can be reloaded or accessed by
other programs. Maybe even by other languages.

For more information, read the perldoc for this module.

I (Mike Wong) am the current maintainer; I welcome bug reports,
comments and suggestions to make this a better module for helping
you to do what you need. Contact me via e-mail at 
<mike_w3@pacbell.net>. 

Better yet, if you're in Sonoma County of California, USA, join the 
Sonoma Perl Mongers and we can talk there. For more information on

INSTALLATION

To install this module, type the following: 

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires version 2.16 or greater of the XML::Parser module.
The latest version is available at any CPAN archive.

This module also optionally depends on Compress::Zlib. If you install
Compress::Zlib, you may read and write zlib-compressed XML files.
Zlib is the compression library that gzip and gunzip use for their
compression/decompression scheme. The XML files that are zlib-
compressed are compatible with gzip and gunzip. XML is an extremely
regular file format and benefits greatly from compression; installing
Compress::Zlib is highly recommended.
