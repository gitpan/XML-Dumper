NAME
XML::Dumper Version 0.4

DESCRIPTION
XML::Dumper dumps Perl data to a structured XML format.
XML::Dumper can also read XML data that was previously dumped
by the module and convert it back to Perl.

This might be useful for dumping Perl objects to files
using an XML format that can be reloaded or accessed by
other programs. Maybe even other languages.

Feel free to contact me at eisen@pobox.com if you have 
problems and/or suggestions.

REQUIREMENTS
This module requires version 2.16 or greater of the XML::Parser module.
The latest version is available at any CPAN archive.

INSTALLATION
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
